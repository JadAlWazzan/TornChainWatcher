# TornChainWatcher
Userscript to helps chain watchers in Torn

When selected threshold is met, the screen starts flashing red to grab your attention. 

Has a toggle to hide everything on the screen and show the chain timer in the corner if you are at work or school (You should not play at school). 

This does not need an API key, as it fetches the time from the document. 

This scrips helps, but you should keep an eye on the game if you are actively chain watching.
